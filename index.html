            <p> &emsp; The only substantial piece of paper would be the degree certificate for successfully completing- <strong>Bachelors of Engineering</strong> in <strong>Computer Science</strong> from <strong>Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra</strong> (2011-2015). That's it. No more degrees/diplomas. I got enlightened by then ðŸ˜ƒ</p>
